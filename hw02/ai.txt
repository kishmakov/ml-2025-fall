Использовал ИИ для генерации начального кода графиков и кода поиска самых коррелирующих фичей через Copilot.

==========================================

Give me a code to plot a dependency of `cnt` column against remaining columns.
Do the code concise, scatter plots should be very simple: only points and axes.
Unite resulting plots into a grid.

=======

I want to use three different colors for points, based on value of 'holiday' and
'workingday' column. When both are zeros it should be one color, when one of them
is one it should be another. There are no rows, where both values are ones.

=======

Extract common logic of plot drawing into a function and call this function for a and for s2

=======

`df` contains a number of features, which can have a big mutual covariance. Given that `cnt` is a target feature, give me a code to list pairs with highest mutual covariance: sort them by decreasing absolute value of covariance and list top 5.
